The building blocks for coding sound on the digital_cafe looper.

## Cafeteria_mono

Cafeteria_mono is the first release of the new cafe series by Ciat Lonbarde. It is composed of a digital delay/processor called the digital_cafe, and also an analog section called quantum_experiment, and a special edition theremin dubstep instrument, the tier_horn. The digital_cafe, using an esp32, is programmable and hackable. To do that, start by visiting github.com/pblasser/esp_cafe, and learning to upload your own versions by arduino. 

The Cafeteria is a mono instrument, but it will be followed shortly in a few months by another new release, called Cafe_Quantum, which reproduces the modular layout and stereo capabilities of its predecessor, the Cocoquantus. Both channels of the new Cafe_Quantum will also be programmable. It will also have a preamp, like the original.
